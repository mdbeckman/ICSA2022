## Foundations for NLP-assisted formative assessment feedback for short-answer tasks in large-enrollment classes

*June 22, 2022*

## Abstract

Research has linked "write-to-learn" tasks to improved learning outcomes, yet constructed-response methods of formative assessment become unwieldy for instructors with large class sizes. Responses collected on six short-answer tasks, from a sample of 1,935 students, were divided among trained evaluators to measure interand intra-rater agreement. A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm scored a subset of student responses for correctness. Quadratic weighted kappas (QWK) for pairwise rater agreement between 0.74 - 0.83, and Fleissâ€™ Kappa of 0.68 for group agreement, indicate substantial inter-rater agreement among raters, including the algorithm. One rater had reviewed a subset of 188 responses seven years earlier, resulting in an estimated intra-rater agreement of QWK = 0.89. Two NLP algorithms were compared, the first being a logistic regression (LR) combined with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for learning vector representations, and the second being the Semantic Feature-Wise Transformation Relation Network (SFRN). The team then piloted cluster analysis of student responses to determine if a set of student responses that have the same correctness can be grouped into semantically similar clusters. Future work will refine the clustering algorithm such that instructors may interpret meanings common within clusters to provide scalable, formative assessment feedback.
